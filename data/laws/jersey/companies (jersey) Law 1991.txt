do not apply in respect of a conversion of shares in accordance with
Article 40A or 40B.

If provision for the variation of the rights of any class of members is made in the
memorandum or articles, or by the terms of admission to membership, those rights
may only be varied in accordance with those provisions.

(3)

If no such provision is made, the rights may be varied if but only if the following
persons consent in writing, namely –
(a)

in the case of any class of par value shares, the holders of not less than 2/3rds
in nominal value of the issued shares of that class;

(b)

in the case of any class of no par shares, the holders of not less than 2/3rds in
number of the issued shares of that class; or

(c)

in the case of any class of guarantor members, those whose liability as such

members of that class,

or (in any case) the variation is sanctioned by a special resolution passed at a separate
meeting of the class of members concerned.
(4)

A variation which –

reduces the liability of any class of members to contribute to the share capital
of a company;

(b)

reduces the liability of any class of members otherwise to pay money to a
company; or

(c)

increases the benefits to which any class of members is or may become
entitled,

is for the purposes of this Article a variation of the rights of each other class of
members of the company.

increased; and

An alteration of a provision in either the memorandum or articles for the variation of

Application to Court for order of confirmation
(1)

Where a company has passed a resolution for reducing a capital account, it may apply

(b)

the payment (whether in cash or otherwise) to a shareholder of any paid up
capital,

and in any other case if the court so directs, paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) have effect,
but subject throughout to paragraph (6).187
(3)

Every creditor of the company who at the date fixed by the court is entitled to a debt
or claim which if that date were the commencement of the winding up of the
company, would be admissible in proof against the company is entitled to object to
the reduction of capital.

(4)

The court shall settle a list of creditors entitled to object, and for that purpose –

(6)

(a)

shall ascertain, as far as possible, without requiring an application from any
creditor, the names of those creditors and the nature and amount of their debts
or claims; and

(b)

may publish notices fixing a day or days within which creditors not entered
on the list are to claim to be so entered or are to be excluded from the right of
objecting to the reduction of capital.

If a creditor entered on the list whose debt or claim is not discharged or has not
determined does not consent to the reduction, the court may dispense with the
consent of that creditor, on the company securing payment of the creditor’s debt or
claim by appropriating (as the court may direct) the following amount –
(a)

if the company admits the full amount of the debt or claim or, though not
admitting it, is willing to provide for it, then the full amount of the debt or
claim;

(b)

if the company does not admit, and is not willing to provide for, the full
amount of the debt or claim, or if the amount is contingent or not ascertained,
then an amount fixed by the court after an enquiry and adjudication.

If a proposed reduction of capital involves either the diminution of a liability in
respect of unpaid capital or the payment (whether in cash or otherwise) to a
shareholder of paid up capital, the court may, if having regard to any special
circumstances of the case it thinks proper to do so, direct that paragraphs (3) to (5)
shall not apply as regards any class or any classes of creditors.188

Where a par value company’s share capital is reduced, a member of the company
(past or present) is not liable in respect of any share to a call or contribution
exceeding in amount the difference (if any) between the amount of the share as fixed

is deemed to have been paid on it.192

(2)

Paragraphs (3) and (4) apply if –
(a)

a creditor, entitled in respect of a debt or claim to object to the reduction of

after the reduction of capital, the company is unable to pay the amount of the
creditor’s debt or claim.

in question an amount not exceeding that which the person would have been liable
to contribute if the company had commenced to be wound up on the day before that
date.

(4)

If the company is wound up under this Law, or a declaration is made under the
Désastre Law, the court, on the application of the creditor in question and proof of
ignorance referred to in paragraph (2)(a) may settle accordingly a list of persons so
liable to contribute, and make and enforce calls and orders on the contributories
settled on the list, as if they were ordinary contributories in a winding up.

enters into a contract with him or her which is not in writing, the company shall
ensure that the terms of the contract are either set out in a written memorandum or
recorded in the minutes of the first meeting of the directors of the company following
the making of the contract.

75

(2)

If a company fails to comply with paragraph (1), it and every officer of it in default
are guilty of an offence.

(3)

Failure to comply with paragraph (1) shall not affect the validity of the contract.

the operation of any other enactment or rule of law applying to contracts between a

(5)

Paragraph (1) of this Article does not apply to contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of the company’s business.

Duty of directors to disclose interests

A director of a company who has, directly or indirectly, an interest in a transaction
entered into or proposed to be entered into by the company or by a subsidiary of the

company and of which the director is aware, shall disclose to the company the nature
and extent of the director’s interest.

(2)

The disclosure shall be made –
(a)

at the first meeting of the directors at which the transaction is considered after
the director concerned becomes aware of the circumstances giving rise to his
or her duty to make it; or

if for any reason the director fails to comply with sub-paragraph (a), as soon
as practical after that meeting, by notice in writing delivered to the

Consequences of failure to comply with Article 75
(1)

Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), where a director fails to disclose an interest of the
director under Article 75 the company or a member of the company may apply to the
court for an order setting aside the transaction concerned and directing that the
director account to the company for any profit or gain realised, and the court may so
order or make such other order as it thinks fit.

(2)

A transaction is not voidable, and a director is not accountable, under paragraph (1)
where, notwithstanding a failure to comply with Article 75 –

(3)

77

Article 76

(a)

the transaction is confirmed by special resolution; and

(b)

the nature and extent of the director’s interest in the transaction were disclosed
in reasonable detail in the notice calling the meeting at which the resolution is
passed.

Without prejudice to its power to order that a director account for any profit or gain
realised, the court shall not set aside a transaction unless it is satisfied that –
(a)

the interests of third parties who have acted in good faith thereunder would
not thereby be unfairly prejudiced; and

(b)

the transaction was not reasonable and fair in the interests of the company at
the time it was entered into.

Indemnity of officers and former officers

Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), any provision, whether contained in the articles

subsidiaries or any other person, for some benefit conferred or detriment suffered
directly or indirectly by the company, agrees to exempt any person from, or
indemnify any person against, any liability which by law would otherwise attach to
the person by reason of the fact that the person is or was an officer of the company
shall be void.

(2)

Paragraph (1) does not apply to a provision for exempting a person from or
indemnifying the person against –
(a)

(b)

any liabilities incurred in defending any proceedings (whether civil or
criminal) –
(i)

in which judgment is given in the person’s favour or the person is
acquitted,

(ii)

which are discontinued otherwise than for some benefit conferred by
the person or on the person’s behalf or some detriment suffered by the
person, or

(iii)

which are settled on terms which include such benefit or detriment and,
in the opinion of a majority of the directors of the company (excluding
any director who conferred such benefit or on whose behalf such benefit
was conferred or who suffered such detriment), the person was
substantially successful on the merits in the person’s resistance to the
proceedings;

any liability incurred otherwise than to the company if the person acted in
good faith with a view to the best interests of the company;

any liability incurred in connection with an application made under
Article 212 in which relief is granted to the person by the court; or

(d)

any liability against which the company normally maintains insurance for
persons other than directors.

(3)

Nothing in this Article shall deprive a person of any exemption or indemnity to
which the person was lawfully entitled in respect of anything done or omitted by the
person before the coming into force of this Article.

such officer insurance against any such liability.

the Minister, the Commission, or the Attorney General may apply to the court for an
order to that effect against the person.

concerned in the management of a body corporate.

(3)

court directs.

(4)

A person who acts in contravention of an order made under this Article is guilty of

record the person’s disqualification in a form approved by the Commission.222

Personal responsibility for liabilities where person acts while disqualified 223

A person who acts in contravention of an order made under Article 78 is personally
responsible for such liabilities of the company or other body corporate as are incurred
at a time when that person was, in contravention of the order, involved in its
management.

(2)

Where a person is personally responsible under paragraph (1) for liabilities of a
company or other body corporate, the person is jointly and severally liable in respect
of those liabilities with it and with any other person who, whether under this Article
or otherwise, is so liable.

Paragraphs (2) and (3) shall have effect subject to paragraphs (4) to (7).

(2)

Every public company and every relevant private company shall in each year hold a
general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other meetings in
that year and shall specify the meeting as such in the notice calling it; but so long as

incorporation, it need not hold it in the year of its incorporation or in the following
year.233

(2A) In this Article “relevant private company” means a private company –

as the annual general meeting for the year in which it is held, unless at that meeting
the company resolves that it shall be so treated.241

(5)

Where a company so resolves, a copy of the resolution shall, within 21 days after it
is passed, be forwarded to the registrar and recorded by the registrar; and if default
is made in complying with this paragraph, the company is guilty of an offence.

Requisition of meetings
(1)

The directors of a company shall, notwithstanding anything in the company’s
articles, on a members’ requisition forthwith proceed to call a general meeting or, as
the case may be, a meeting of any class of members to be held as soon as practicable
but in any case not later than 2 months after the date of the deposit of the
requisition.242

(2)

A members’ requisition is a requisition of members of the company holding at the
date of the deposit of the requisition not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights
of the members of the company who have the right to vote at the meeting
requisitioned.243

(3)

The requisition shall state the objects of the meeting, and shall be signed by or on
behalf of the requisitionists and deposited at the registered office of the company,
and may consist of several documents in similar form each signed by or on behalf of
one or more requisitionists.

(4)

If the directors do not within 21 days from the date of the deposit of the requisition
proceed duly to call a meeting to be held within 2 months of that date, the
requisitionists, or any of them representing more than one half of the total voting
rights of all of them, may themselves call a meeting, but a meeting so called shall
not be held after 3 months from that date.

(5)

A meeting called under this Article by requisitionists shall be called in the same
manner, as nearly as possible, as that in which meetings are to be called by directors.

(6)

Reasonable expenses incurred by the requisitionists by reason of the failure of the
directors to call a meeting shall be repaid to the requisitionists by the company, and
sums so repaid shall be retained by the company out of sums due or to become due

from the company by way of fees or other remunerations in respect of their services
to the directors who were in default.
(7)

90

In the case of a meeting at which a resolution is to be proposed as a special resolution
the directors are deemed not to have duly called the meeting if they do not give the
notice required for special resolutions by Article 90.

Definition of special resolution
(1)

A resolution is a special resolution when it has been passed by the majority specified
in paragraph (1A) of the members who (being entitled to do so) vote in person, or by
proxy, at a general meeting of the company or at a separate meeting of a class of
members of the company of which in either case not less than 14 days’ notice,
specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution, has been
duly given.244

(1A) The majority to which paragraph (1) refers is –
(a)

two-thirds, if the articles of the company do not specify a greater majority; or

(b)

if the articles specify a greater majority than two-thirds (or unanimity), that
greater majority (or unanimity).245

(1B) Where the articles make different provision in relation to different descriptions of
special resolutions, the reference in paragraph (1A) to the majority specified by the
articles (or unanimity) is to the majority specified by the articles in relation to special
resolutions of the description of the special resolution concerned (or unanimity, if
that is what is so specified).246

91

(2)

If it is so agreed by a majority in number of the members having the right to attend
and vote at such a meeting upon the resolution, being a majority together holding not
less than 95% of the total voting rights of the members who have that right, a
resolution may be proposed and passed as a special resolution at a meeting of which
less than 14 days’ notice has been given.247

(3)

At a meeting at which a special resolution is proposed, a declaration by the chairman
that the resolution is carried is, unless a poll is demanded, conclusive evidence of the
fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or
against the resolution.

(4)

In computing the majority on a poll demanded on the question that a special
resolution be passed, reference is to be had to the number of votes cast for and against
the resolution.

(5)

For the purposes of this Article, notice of a meeting shall be deemed to be duly given
and the meeting duly held, when the notice is given and the meeting held in the
manner provided by this Law or the company’s articles.

(6)

References in this Law to a special resolution are, unless otherwise expressly
provided, references to a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the
company.

Notice of meetings
(1)

A provision of a company’s articles is void insofar as it provides for the calling of a
meeting of the company or of any class of members of the company (other than an
adjourned meeting) by a shorter notice than 14 days’ notice in writing.248

Article 92

(2)

Save insofar as the articles of a company make other provision in that behalf (not
being a provision avoided by paragraph (1)), any such meeting of the company (other
than an adjourned meeting) may be called by 14 days’ notice in writing.249

(3)

Notwithstanding that a meeting is called by shorter notice than that specified in
paragraph (2) or in the company’s articles (as the case may be), it is deemed to have
been duly called if it so agreed –
(a)

in the case of a meeting called as the annual general meeting, by all the
members entitled to attend and vote thereat; and

(b)

otherwise, by a majority in number of the persons who have the right to attend
and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than 90 per
cent of the total voting rights of the members who have that right, or, if the
articles require a greater majority of such persons (or unanimity), by that
greater majority (or unanimity).250

General provisions as to meetings and votes251
(1)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the memorandum or articles of a private
company with only one member, or in the terms of admission to membership of such
a company, he or she shall be the quorum at any meeting of the company, or of any
class of member, when he or she is present personally or by his or her proxy.

(2)

Subject to paragraph (1), in so far as the memorandum or articles of a company or
the terms of admission to membership of the company do not make other provision
in that behalf, the following provisions shall apply to any meeting of the company
or of any class of members of the company –
(a)

notice of a meeting shall be given, to every member entitled to receive it, by
delivering or posting it to his or her registered address;

(b)

at a meeting of the company, 2 members present personally shall be a quorum;

(c)

at a meeting (other than an adjourned meeting) of any class of members –
(i)

in the case of a class of par value shares, the quorum shall be persons
holding or representing by proxy not less than 1/3rd in nominal value
of the issued shares of that class,

(ii)

in the case of a class of no par value shares, the quorum shall be persons
holding or representing by proxy not less than 1/3rd in number of the
issued shares of that class, and

(iii)

in the case of a class of guarantor members, the quorum shall be persons
whose liability as such members, or representing by proxy persons
whose liability as such members, is in the aggregate not less than 1/3rd
of the total liability of all members of that class,

and where any such meeting has been adjourned, the quorum on its resumption
shall be one person of the class or his or her proxy;
(d)

any member, or director of the company, elected by the members present at a
meeting may be chairman of that meeting;

(e)

on a show of hands, every member present in person at a meeting has one
vote; and

Representation of body corporate at meetings
(1)

A body corporate, whether or not a company within the meaning of this Law, may
by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorize such person or
persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting
of a company, or of any class of members of a company, or of creditors of a company
which it is entitled to attend.252

(2)

Where the body corporate authorizes only one person, the person is entitled to
exercise the same powers on behalf of the body corporate which the person
represents as that body corporate could exercise if it were an individual member or
creditor of the company.253

(3)

Where the body corporate authorizes more than one person, any one of them is
entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the body corporate which they
represent as that body corporate could exercise if it were an individual member or
creditor of the company.254

(4)

Where the body corporate authorizes more than one person and more than one of
them purport to exercise a power under paragraph (3) –
(a)

if they purport to exercise the power in the same way, the power is treated as
exercised in that way; and

(b)

if they do not purport to exercise the power in the same way, the power is
treated as not exercised.255

Power of court to order meetings
(1)

If for any reason it is impracticable to call a meeting of a company, or of any class
of members of a company, in a manner in which those meetings may be called, or to
conduct the meeting in the manner specified in the articles or this Law, the court
may, either of its own motion or on the application –
(a)

of a director of the company; or

(b)

of a member of the company who would be entitled to vote at the meeting,

order a meeting to be called, held and conducted in any manner the court thinks fit.256
(2)

95

Where such an order is made, the court may give such ancillary or consequential
directions as it thinks expedient; and these may include a direction that one member
of the company present in person or by proxy be deemed to constitute a meeting.

meeting and has effect as if agreed by the company in general meeting; and

(c)

the decision is not taken by way of a resolution in writing,

the member shall provide the company with a record in writing of the decision.

Article 97

A provision contained in a company’s articles is void in so far as it would have the
effect of requiring the instrument appointing a proxy, or any other document
necessary to show the validity of, or otherwise relating to, the appointment of a
proxy, to be received by the company or any other person before the beginning of
the period commencing 48 hours before a meeting or adjourned meeting in order that
the appointment may be effective.271

(4A) In calculating the period mentioned in paragraph (4) no account shall be taken of any
part of a day that is not a working day.272
(4B) For the purposes of paragraph (4A) “working day” means a weekday (within the
meaning of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey)
Act 2010) other than –

97

(a)

a day specified in that Schedule as a day which is to be observed as a public
holiday; or

(b)

a day noted in that Schedule as a day which is by custom observed as a general
holiday.273

(5)

If for the purpose of a meeting of a company, invitations to appoint as proxy a person
or one of a number of persons specified in the invitations are issued at the company’s
expense to some only of the members entitled to be given notice of the meeting and
to vote at it by proxy, then every officer of the company who knowingly and wilfully
authorizes or permits their issue in that manner is guilty of an offence; but an officer
is not so liable by reason only of the issue to a member at the member’s request in
writing of a form of appointment naming the proxy, or a list of persons willing to act
as proxy, if the form or list is available on request in writing to every member entitled
to vote at the meeting by proxy.

(6)

This Article applies to meetings of any class of members as it applies to general
meetings.274

Demand for poll
(1)

(2)

A provision contained in a company’s articles is void in so far as it would have the
effect either –
(a)

of excluding the right to demand a poll at a general meeting, or at a meeting
of any class of members, on a question other than the election of the chairman
of the meeting or the adjournment of the meeting; or

(b)

of making ineffective a demand for a poll on any such question which is made
either –
(i)

by not less than 5 members having the right to vote on the question, or

(ii)

by a member or members representing not less than 1/10th of the total
voting rights of all the members having the right to vote on the
question.275

The instrument appointing a proxy to vote at such a meeting is deemed also to confer
authority to demand or join in demanding a poll; and for the purposes of
paragraph (1) a demand by a person as proxy for a member is the same as a demand
by the member.

Article 98

On a poll taken at such a meeting, a member entitled to more than one vote need not,
if the member votes, (in person or by proxy) use all the member’s votes or cast all
the votes the member uses in the same way.

Minutes
(1)

Every company shall cause minutes of all proceedings at general meetings, meetings
of any class of its members, meetings of its directors and of committees of directors
to be entered in books kept for that purpose, and the names of the directors present
at each such meeting shall be recorded in the minutes.276

(2)

Any such minute, if purporting to be signed by the chairman of the meeting at which
the proceedings took place, or by the chairman of the next succeeding meeting, is
evidence of the proceedings.

(3)

Where minutes have been made in accordance with this Article then, until the
contrary is proved, the meeting is deemed duly held and convened, and all
proceedings which took place at the meeting to have duly taken place.

(4)

If a company fails to comply with paragraph (1), the company and every officer of
it who is in default is guilty of an offence.

Inspection of minute books
(1)

The books containing the minutes of a general meeting or of a meeting of any class
of members held after this Article comes into force shall be kept at the company’s
registered office, and shall during business hours be open to the inspection of a
member without charge.277

(2)

A member may require, on submission to the company of a written request and on
payment of such sum (if any), not exceeding the published maximum, as the
company may require, a copy of any such minutes and the company shall, within 7
days after the receipt of the request and the payment, cause the copy so required to
be made available at the registered office of the company for collection during
business hours.278

(3)

If an inspection required under this Article is refused or if a copy required under this
Article is not sent within the proper time, the company is guilty of an offence.

(4)

In the case of a refusal or default, the court may make an order compelling an
immediate inspection of the books in respect of all proceedings of general meetings,
or meetings of any class of members or directing that the copies required be furnished
to the persons requiring them.279

Companies (Jersey) Law 1991

(2)

Article 115

A company shall not make a distribution except in accordance with this Article if the
distribution –
(a)

reduces the net assets of the company; or

(b)

is in respect of shares which (in accordance with the generally accepted
accounting principles adopted in the preparation of the most recent accounts
of the company prepared under Article 105 or, if none have been, proposed to
be adopted in the preparation of the first accounts of the company so prepared)
are required to be recognized as a liability in the accounts of the company.334

(2A) In paragraph (2) “the net assets of the company” means the aggregate of the
company’s assets less the aggregate of its liabilities; and any question as to whether
a distribution reduces the amount of the net assets of the company for the purposes
of that paragraph is to be determined in accordance with the generally accepted
accounting principles adopted in the preparation of the most recent accounts of the
company prepared under Article 105 or, if none have been, proposed to be adopted
in the preparation of the first accounts of the company so prepared.335
(3)

A company (other than an open-ended investment company) may make a distribution
only if the directors who are to authorize the distribution make a statement in
accordance with paragraph (4).

(4)

The statement shall state that the directors of the company who are to authorize the
distribution have formed the opinion –
(a)

that, immediately following the date on which the distribution is proposed to
be made, the company will be able to discharge its liabilities as they fall due;
and

(b)

that, having regard to –
(i)

the prospects of the company and to the intentions of the directors with
respect to the management of the company’s business, and

(ii)

the amount and character of the financial resources that will in their
view be available to the company,

the company will be able to –
(A)

continue to carry on business, and

(B)

discharge its liabilities as they fall due,

until the expiry of the period of 12 months immediately following the date on
which the distribution is proposed to be made or until the company is
dissolved under Article 150, whichever first occurs.
(5)

A director who makes a statement under paragraph (4) without having reasonable
grounds for the opinion expressed in the statement is guilty of an offence.

(6)

Despite any other provision of this Law, an open-ended investment company may
make a distribution only if the directors who are to authorize the distribution
reasonably believe that immediately after the distribution has been made the
company will be able to discharge its liabilities as they fall due.

(7)

A distribution made in accordance with this Article shall be debited by the company
to –
(a)

Where a distribution has been made by a company in contravention of Article 115
and the company makes an application to the court, the court shall make an order
that the distribution is to be treated for all purposes as if it had been made in
accordance with that Article if the court –
(a)

considers that all of the conditions specified in paragraph (2) are met; and

(b)

does not consider that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so.

The conditions referred to in paragraph (1)(a) are that –
(a)

immediately after the distribution was made the company was able to
discharge its liabilities as they fell due;

(b)

at the time when the application is determined by the court the company is
able to discharge its liabilities as they fall due; and

(c)

where the distribution was made less than 12 months before the date on which
application is determined, the company will be able to carry on business, and
discharge its liabilities as they fall due, until the end of the period of 12 months
beginning with the date on which the distribution was made.

No notice of an application under paragraph (1) need be given to any creditor of the
company, or any other person, unless the court otherwise directs.

115A Consequences of unlawful distribution
If a distribution or part of a distribution made by a company to one of its members is made
in contravention of Article 115 (and is not treated as if it had been made in accordance with
that Article by virtue of an order under Article 115ZA) and at the time of the distribution
the member knows or has reasonable grounds for believing that it is so made, the member
is liable –
(a)

to repay it or the part of it to the company; or

(b)

if a distribution was made otherwise than in cash, to pay to the company a sum equal
to the value of the distribution or the part of it at that time.340

Article 116

PART 18
TAKEOVERS342
116 Takeover offers
(1)

In this Part, “a takeover offer” means an offer to acquire all the shares, or all the
shares of any class or classes, in a company (other than shares which at the date of
the offer are already held by the offeror), being an offer on terms which are the same
in relation to all the shares to which the offer relates or, where those shares include
shares of different classes, in relation to all the shares of each class.

(2)

In paragraph (1) “shares” means shares (other than relevant treasury shares) that
have been allotted on the date of the offer.343

(2A) A takeover offer may include among the shares to which it relates –
(a)

all or any shares that are allotted after the date of the offer but before a
specified date;

(b)

all or any relevant treasury shares that cease to be held as treasury shares
before a specified date; and

(c)

all or any other relevant treasury shares.344

(2B) In this Article –
“relevant treasury shares” means shares which –
(a)

are held by the company as treasury shares on the date of the offer; or

(b)

become shares held by the company as treasury shares after that date but
before a specified date;

“specified date” means a date specified in or determined in accordance with the terms
of the offer.345
(2C) An offer is not prevented from being a takeover offer by reason of not being made
to shareholders whose registered address is not in Jersey if –
(a)

the offer was not made to those shareholders in order not to contravene the
law of a country or territory outside Jersey; and

(b)

either –
(i)

the offer is published in the Jersey Gazette, or

(ii)

a document containing the terms of the offer can be inspected, or a copy
of it obtained, at a place in Jersey or on a website, and a notice is
published in the Jersey Gazette specifying the address of that place or
website.346

(2D) Where an offer is made to acquire shares in a company and there are persons for
whom, by reason of the law of a country or territory outside Jersey, it is impossible
to accept the offer, or more difficult to do so, that does not prevent the offer from
being a takeover offer.347
(2E) It is not to be inferred –
(a)

that an offer which is not made to every holder of shares, or every holder of
shares of any class or classes, in the company cannot be a takeover offer unless
the requirements of paragraph (2C) are met; or
Official Consolidated Version
27 February 2024 – Current

Page - 121

Companies (Jersey) Law 1991

(b)

Article 117

that an offer which is impossible, or more difficult, for certain persons to
accept cannot be a takeover offer unless the reason for the impossibility or
difficulty is the one mentioned in paragraph (2D).348

(3)

The terms offered in relation to any shares shall for the purposes of this Article be
treated as being the same in relation to all the shares or, as the case may be, all the
shares of a class to which the offer relates notwithstanding any variation permitted
by paragraph (4).

(4)

A variation is permitted by this paragraph where –
(a)

the law of a country or territory outside Jersey precludes the acceptance of an
offer in the form or any of the forms specified or precludes it except after
compliance by the offeror with conditions with which the offeror is unable to
comply or which the offeror regards as unduly onerous; and

(b)

the variation is such that the persons by whom the acceptance of an offer in
that form is precluded are able to accept an offer otherwise than in that form
but of substantially equivalent value.

(5)

The reference in paragraph (1) to shares already held by the offeror includes a
reference to shares which the offeror has contracted to acquire but that shall not be
construed as including shares which are the subject of a contract binding the holder
to accept the offer when it is made, being a contract entered into by the holder for
nothing other than a promise by the offeror to make the offer.349

(6)

Where the terms of an offer make provision for their revision and for acceptances on
the previous terms to be treated as acceptances on the revised terms, the revision
shall not be regarded for the purposes of this Part as the making of a fresh offer and
references in this Part to the date of the offer shall accordingly be construed as
references to the date on which the original offer was made.

(7)

In this Part the “offeror” means, subject to Article 122, the person making a takeover
offer and the “company” means the company whose shares are the subject of the
offer.

117 Right of offeror to buy out minority shareholders
(1)

If, in a case in which a takeover offer does not relate to shares of different classes,
the offeror has by virtue of acceptances of the offer acquired or contracted to
acquire –
(a)

in the case of a par value company, not less than 9/10ths in nominal value of
the shares to which the offer relates; or

(b)

in the case of a no par value company, not less than 9/10ths in number of the
shares to which the offer relates,

the offeror may give notice, to the holder of any shares to which the offer relates
which the offeror has not acquired or contracted to acquire, that he or she desires to
acquire those shares.350
(2)

If, in a case in which a takeover offer relates to shares of different classes, the offeror
has by virtue of acceptances of the offer acquired or contracted to acquire –
(a)

in the case of a par value company, not less than 9/10ths in nominal value of
the shares of any class to which the offer relates; or

Companies (Jersey) Law 1991

(b)

Article 118

in the case of a no par value company, not less than 9/10ths in number of the
shares of any class to which the offer relates,

the offeror may give notice, to the holder of any shares of that class which the offeror
has not acquired or contracted to acquire, that he or she desires to acquire those
shares.351
(3)

No notice shall be given under paragraph (1) or (2) unless the offeror has acquired
or contracted to acquire the shares necessary to satisfy the minimum specified in that
paragraph before the end of the period of 4 months beginning with the date of the
offer; and no such notice shall be given after the end of the period of 2 months
beginning with the date on which the offeror has acquired or contracted to acquire
shares which satisfy that minimum.

(4)

When the offeror gives the first notice in relation to an offer he or she shall send a
copy of it to the company together with a declaration by the offeror that the
conditions for the giving of the notice are satisfied.

(5)

Where the offeror is a body corporate (whether or not a company within the meaning
of this Law) the declaration shall be signed by a director.

(6)

Any person who fails to send a copy of a notice or a declaration as required by
paragraph (4) or makes such a declaration for the purposes of that paragraph
knowing it to be false or without having reasonable grounds for believing it to be
true is guilty of an offence.

(7)

If a person is charged with any offence for failing to send a copy of a notice as
required by paragraph (4) it is a defence for the person to prove that the person took
reasonable steps for securing compliance with that paragraph.

(8)

Where during the period within which a takeover offer can be accepted the offeror
acquires or contracts to acquire any of the shares to which the offer relates but
otherwise than by virtue of acceptances of the offer, then if –
(a)

the value of that for which they are acquired or contracted to be acquired (the
“acquisition value”) does not at that time exceed the value of that which is
receivable by an acceptor under the terms of the offer; or

(b)

those terms are subsequently revised so that when the revision is announced
the acquisition value, at the time mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), no longer
exceeds the value of that which is receivable by an acceptor under those terms,

the offeror shall be treated for the purposes of this Article as having acquired or
contracted to acquire those shares by virtue of acceptances of the offer; but in any
other case those shares shall be treated as excluded from those to which the offer
relates.

118 Effect of notice under Article 117
(1)

The following provisions shall, subject to Article 121, have effect where a notice is
given in respect of any shares under Article 117.

(2)

The offeror shall be entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms of the
offer.

(3)

Where the terms of an offer are such as to give the holder of any shares a choice of
payment for the holder’s shares the notice shall give particulars of the choice and
state –

Article 118

(a)

that the holder of the shares may within 6 weeks from the date of the notice
indicate the holder’s choice by a written communication sent to the offeror at
an address specified in the notice; and

(b)

which payment specified in the offer is to be taken as applying in default of
the holder indicating a choice as aforesaid,

and the terms of the offer mentioned in paragraph (2) shall be determined
accordingly.
(4)

Paragraph (3) applies whether or not any time limit or other conditions applicable to
the choice under the terms of the offer can still be complied with; and if the payment
chosen by the holder of the shares –
(a)

is not cash and the offeror is no longer able to make that payment; or

(b)

was to have been made by a third party who is no longer bound or able to
make that payment,

the payment shall be taken to consist of an amount of cash payable by the offeror
which at the date of the notice is equivalent to the chosen payment.
(5)

At the end of 6 weeks from the date of the notice the offeror shall forthwith–
(a)

send a copy of the notice to the company; and

(b)

make payment to the company for the shares to which the notice relates.

(6)

The copy of the notice sent to the company under paragraph (5)(a) shall be
accompanied by an instrument of transfer executed on behalf of the shareholder by
a person appointed by the offeror; and on receipt of that instrument the company
shall register the offeror as the holder of those shares.

(7)

Where the payment referred to in paragraph (5)(b) is to be made in shares or
securities to be allotted by the offeror the reference in that paragraph to the making
of payment shall be construed as a reference to the allotment of the shares or
securities to the company.

(8)

Any sum received by a company under paragraph (5)(b) and any other payment
received under that paragraph shall be held by the company on trust for the person
entitled to the shares in respect of which the sum or other payment was received.

(9)

Any sum received by a company under paragraph (5)(b) and any dividend or other
sum accruing from any other payment received by a company under that paragraph,
shall be paid into a separate bank account, being an account the balance on which
bears interest at an appropriate rate and can be withdrawn by such notice (if any) as
is appropriate.

(10) Where after reasonable enquiry made at such intervals as are reasonable the person
entitled to any sum or other payment held on trust by virtue of paragraph (8) cannot
be found and 10 years have elapsed since the sum or other payment was received or
the company is wound up, the sum or other payment (together with any interest,
dividend or other benefit that has accrued from it) shall be paid to the Viscount.
(11) The expenses of any such enquiry as is mentioned in paragraph (10) may be defrayed
out of the money or other property held on trust for the person or persons to whom
the enquiry relates.

Article 122

that there has been unreasonable delay in making the application or
unreasonable conduct on the shareholder’s part in conducting the proceedings
on the application.

Where a takeover offer has not been accepted to the extent necessary for entitling
the offeror to give notices under Article 117 (1) or (2) the court may, on the
application of the offeror, make an order authorizing the offeror to give notices under
that Article if satisfied –
(a)

persons mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), amount to not less than the minimum

is just and equitable to do so having regard, in particular, to the number of

the rights and obligations of the offeror under those Articles and Articles 118 and
120 shall be respectively joint rights and joint and several obligations of the joint
offerors.

(3)

It shall be a sufficient compliance with any provision of those Articles requiring or
authorizing a notice or other document to be given or sent by or to the joint offerors
that it is given or sent by or to any of them; but the declaration required by
Article 117(4) shall be made by all of them and, in the case of a joint offeror being a

offerors or such of them as they may determine.

In Article 118(4)(a) and Article 120(4)(a) references to the offeror being no longer
able to make the relevant payment shall be construed as references to none of the
joint offerors being able to do so.

offerors except that any application under paragraph (3) or (5) may be made by any
of them and the reference in paragraph (5)(a) to the offeror having been unable to
trace one or more of the persons holding shares shall be construed as a reference to

any such associate holds or has contracted to acquire, whether at the time when the
offer is made or subsequently, shall be disregarded for the purposes of any reference
in this Part to the shares to which a takeover offer relates.

of the offeror acquires or contracts to acquire any of the shares to which the offer
relates, then, if the condition specified in Article 117(8)(a) or (b) is satisfied as
respects those shares, they shall be treated for the purpose of that Article as shares
to which the offer relates.

124 Convertible securities
(1)

company if they are convertible into or entitle the holder to subscribe for such shares;
and references to the holder of shares or a shareholder shall be construed
accordingly.

Paragraph (1) shall not be construed as requiring any securities to be treated –
(a)

as shares of the same class as those into which they are convertible or for
which the holder is entitled to subscribe; or

(b)

as shares of the same class as other securities by reason only that the shares
into which they are convertible or for which the holder is entitled to subscribe

Accordingly –
(a)

a creditor of the company to whom paragraph (1) applies only has the right to

the creditor; and

it in respect of the relevant cell, the creditor shall be liable to pay to the company an
amount equal to the benefit so obtained.

of the company whose cellular assets were wrongfully seized or attached.

pay or return them on demand to the protected cell company,

and shall be guilty of an offence if he or she fails to do so.
(10) Any amount recovered by a protected cell company by virtue of a trust mentioned in
paragraph (7) shall form part of the non-cellular assets of the company or, as the case
may be, the cellular assets of the cell of the company whose cellular assets were

company under paragraph (4), paragraph (5) or paragraph (9)(b) and no amount or
an insufficient amount is received, or no assets or less than all the assets are
recovered, the company must cause or procure an auditor, acting as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, to certify the loss suffered by the company and then, as the case
may be –

transfer to the company from the cellular assets of the relevant cell, if the
liability was attributable to it, an amount sufficient to make good the loss

order made under paragraph (1) may do all or any of the following things, namely –
(a)

require property transferred in connection with the giving of the preference to
be vested in the company;

for security to be provided for the discharge of any obligation imposed

under or by the giving of the preference.

(5)

(a)

prejudice an interest in property that was acquired from a person other than
the company and was acquired in good faith and for value, or prejudice any
interest deriving from such an interest; or

(b)

require a person who in good faith and for value received a benefit from the
preference to pay a sum to the company, except where the payment is in
respect of a preference given to that person at a time when he or she was a
creditor of the company.

In considering for the purpose of this Article whether a person has acted in good
faith, the court may take into consideration –
(a)

(b)
(6)

Article 176A

whether the person had notice –
(i)

of the circumstances that amounted to the giving of the preference by
the company, and

(ii)

giving the preference become insolvent; and

whether the person was an associate of or was connected with either the
company or the person to whom the company gave the preference.

the person is a creditor of the company or a surety or guarantor for a debt or
other liability of the company; and

(b)

the company –
(i)

does anything, or

(ii)

suffers anything to be done,

that has the effect of putting the person into a position which, in the event of
the winding up of the company, will be better than the position he or she would
have been in if that thing had not been done.
(7)

The court shall not make an order under this Article in respect of a preference given
to a person unless the company, when giving the preference, was influenced in
deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the person into a position which, in
the event of the winding up of the company, would be better than the position in
which the person would be if the preference had not been given.

(8)

A company that gave a preference to a person who was, at the time the preference
was given, an associate of or connected with the company (otherwise than by reason
only of being the company’s employee) shall be presumed, unless the contrary is
shown, to have been influenced in deciding to give the preference by the desire
mentioned in paragraph (7).

(9)

Subject to paragraphs (10) and (11), the time at which a company gives a preference
is a relevant time for the purpose of paragraph (1) if the preference was given during
the period of 12 months immediately preceding the commencement of the winding
up.

(10) The time to which paragraph (9) refers is not a relevant time unless –
(a)

the company was insolvent at the time the preference was given; or

direct the person to comply with that paragraph; and

if the application is made with respect to a liquidator, direct that the costs shall

209 Legal professional privilege
Where criminal proceedings are instituted by the Attorney General under this Law against

information which the person is entitled to refuse to disclose on grounds of legal
professional privilege in proceedings in the court.

210 Right to refuse to answer questions
A person may refuse to answer any question put to him or her pursuant to any provision of

of that person, to proceedings under the law of Jersey for an offence or for the recovery of
any penalty.561

211 Relief for private companies
The States may, by Regulations, provide that private companies, or private companies
satisfying conditions specified in the Regulations, shall be exempt from compliance with

212 Power of court to grant relief in certain cases
(1)

If in proceedings for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust against an
officer of a company or a person employed by a company as auditor it appears to the
court that that officer or person is or may be liable in respect of the negligence,
default, breach of duty or breach of trust, but that the person has acted honestly and
that having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including those connected
with his or her appointment) he or she ought fairly to be excused for the negligence,
default, breach of duty or breach of trust, the court may relieve the person, either
wholly or partly, from his or her liability on such terms as it thinks fit.

(2)

If an officer or person mentioned in paragraph (1) has reason to apprehend that a
claim will or might be made against the person in respect of negligence, default,
breach of duty or breach of trust, he or she may apply to the court for relief; and the
court on the application has the same power to relieve the person as it would have
had if proceedings against him or her for negligence, default, breach of duty or
breach of trust had been brought.

213 Power of court to declare dissolution of company void562

(b)

make an order, on such terms as the court thinks fit, declaring the dissolution to have
been void and the court may by the order give such directions and make such
provisions as seem just for placing the company and all other persons in the same
position as nearly as may be as if the company had not been dissolved.

If at any time –

Schedule 2

A contravention of any provision of the former Laws committed before the appointed
day shall not be visited with any more severe punishment under this Law than would
have been applicable under that provision at the time of the contravention; but where
an offence for the continuance of which a penalty was provided has been committed
under any provision of the former Laws, proceedings may be taken under this Law
in respect of the continuance of the offence on and after the appointed day in the like
manner as if the offence had been committed under the corresponding provision of
this Law.

References elsewhere to the former laws
(1)

A reference in any enactment, instrument or document (whether express or implied,

had but for the enactment of this Law, as, or as including, a reference to the
corresponding provision by which it is replaced in this Law.

(2)

The generality of sub-paragraph (1) is not affected by any specific conversion of
references made by this Law, nor by the inclusion in any provision of this Law of a
