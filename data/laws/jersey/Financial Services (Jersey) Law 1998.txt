person, or key person of any class, in relation to a registered person or in respect of
whom notice has been given that the person will become such a principal person,
or key person of any class, is not a fit and proper person to be a principal person, or
key person of that class or of any class, respectively in relation to a registered
person, the Commission shall serve on that person and on the registered person

in the best interests of persons who received or may receive the benefit of
services provided, or arranged, by the registered person in carrying on trust
company business,

that paragraph (3) should not have effect, or should cease to have effect in a
particular case, or that the period specified in paragraph (3)(a) should be reduced,
the Court may so order.59

Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998

Article 25A

whether the business is or was carried on in Jersey or in a country or territory
outside Jersey), and it appears to the Commission to be desirable to issue the
statement in the best interests of –
(i)

persons who transacted or may transact financial service business (other than
trust company business) with the person,

(ii)

persons who entered or may enter into agreements for services provided by
the person in carrying on trust company business,

(iii)

persons who received or may receive the benefit of services provided, or
arranged, by the person in carrying on trust company business, or

(iv)

the public.

25A Notice of public statement101
(1)

If a public statement identifies any person who is registered, the Commission shall
serve notice on the person.

(2)

If a public statement identifies any person who is not registered, and at any time
before the Commission issues the public statement it is reasonably practicable for
the Commission to serve notice on the person, the Commission shall do so.

(3)

A notice under paragraph (1) or (2) shall –

(4)

(5)

(a)

give the reasons for issuing the statement;

(b)

give the proposed or actual date of issue of the statement;

(c)

contain a copy of the statement;

(d)

give particulars of the right of appeal under Article 25C in respect of the
statement; and

(e)

if the statement is issued, in accordance with a decision under
Article 25B(3), before the day specified in Article 25B(1) in relation to the
statement, give the reasons for issuing it before that day.

Paragraph (3) shall not require the Commission –
(a)

to specify any reason that would in the Commission’s opinion involve the
disclosure of confidential information the disclosure of which would be
prejudicial to a third party; or

(b)

to specify the same reasons, or reasons in the same manner, in the case of
notices to different persons about the same matter.

In this Article and Articles 25B and 25C, a reference to the identification of a
person in a public statement does not include the identification, in the statement, of
the Commission or of any other person in their capacity of exercising functions
under this Law.

25B Notice period102
(1)

Paragraph (1) shall not apply if –

(3)

Article 25C

(a)

each of the persons identified (within the meaning of Article 25A) in the
relevant public statement agrees with the Commission that the statement
may be issued on a date earlier than the date that would apply under that
paragraph; and

(b)

the statement is in fact issued on or after the earlier date.

Paragraph (1) shall not apply if –
(a)

the Commission decides on reasonable grounds that the interests of –
(i)

persons who transacted or may transact financial service business
(other than trust company business) with any person identified (within
the meaning of Article 25A) in the relevant public statement,

(ii)

persons who entered or may enter into agreements for services
provided by any person (being a person so identified) in carrying on
trust company business,

(iii)

persons who received or may receive the benefit of services provided,
or arranged, by any person (being a person so identified) in carrying
on trust company business, or

(iv)

the public,

in the issue of the relevant public statement on a date earlier than the date
that would apply under that paragraph outweigh the detriment to the persons
identified in the statement, being the detriment attributable to that earliness;
and
(b)

the statement is in fact issued on or after the earlier date.103

(4)

In making a decision under paragraph (3), the Commission is not prevented from
choosing as the date of issue of a public statement the date of service (if any) of
notice of the statement.

(5)

Despite this Article, if an appeal is made to the Court under Article 25C(1), and the
Court orders that the statement not be issued before any specified date or event, the
Commission shall not issue the statement before the date or event so specified.

(6)

In a case to which paragraph (1) applies, if an appeal is made under Article 25C(2)
to the Court against a decision to issue a public statement, the Commission shall
not issue the statement before the day on which that appeal is determined by the
Court or withdrawn.

that identifies the person may appeal to the Court, in accordance with this Article,

of the Commission was unreasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the
case.

26

Article 26

if no such notice is served on the person, the day that is one month after the
issue of the public statement.

(5)

Nothing in paragraph (4) prevents the lodging of an appeal before a notice is served
or a public statement is issued.

(6)

On an appeal under this Article, the Court may make such interim or final order as
it thinks fit, including an order that the Commission not issue the relevant public
statement or, if the public statement has been issued, that the Commission issue a
further public statement to the effect set out in the order or stop making the
statement available to the public.

Powers of intervention
(1)

Where, on the application of the Commission, the Court is satisfied that –
(a)

(b)

a registered person –
(i)

is not in terms of Article 9(3)(a) a fit and proper person to carry on
financial service business that the registered person is purporting to
carry on,

(ii)

is not fit to carry on financial service business to the extent to which
the registered person is purporting to do, or

(iii)

has committed or is likely to commit a contravention of a type referred

(i)

persons who transacted or may transact financial service business
(other than trust company business) with the registered person,

(ii)

persons who entered or may enter into agreements for services
provided by the registered person in carrying on trust company
business, or

(iii)

persons who received or may receive the benefit of services provided,
or arranged, by the registered person in carrying on trust company
business,

the Court may, as it thinks just, make an order making the registered person’s
business subject to such supervision, restraint or conditions from such time and for
such periods as the Court may specify, and may also make such ancillary orders as
the Court thinks desirable.105
(2)

If, on an application made under paragraph (1), the Court is satisfied that a
registered person has –
(a)

by entering into any transaction with another person, contravened Article 7;

by entering into any transaction with another person, contravened any
condition applicable to the registered person (whether attached to the

induced to enter into a transaction with the registered person or with a third
person; or

(d)

entered into any transaction with another person who was induced to enter
into the transaction as a result of the contravention of Article 39G or 39L by
a third person,

the Court may order any one or more of those persons (and any other person who
appears to the Court to have been knowingly concerned in the contravention) to
take such steps as the Court may direct for restoring one or more of the persons to
the position in which they were before the transaction was entered into.106
(3)

Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1) or (2), an order issued under
either of those paragraphs may include a requirement that all assets, or all assets of
a specified description which, at any time while the requirement is in force –
(a)

(b)

where the registered person carries on financial service business –
(i)

belong to the registered person concerned, or

(ii)

belong to persons with whom the registered person is transacting
financial service business and that are held by or to the registered
person’s order; or

where the registered person carries on trust company business –
(i)

belong to the registered person concerned,

(ii)

are held on behalf of persons who have entered into an agreement for
the provision of services to be provided by the registered person when
carrying on trust company business, or

(iii)

are held on behalf of persons who have received or may receive the
benefit of services provided or arranged by the registered person when
carrying on trust company business,

shall be transferred to and held by a person whose appointment is approved by the
Court (in this Article referred to as an “appointed person”).107
(4)

Where a requirement of a type referred to in paragraph (3) is imposed under this
Article, it shall be the duty of the registered person concerned to transfer the assets
to the appointed person and to give the appointed person all such other assistance
as may be required to enable the appointed person to discharge his or her functions
in accordance with the requirement.

(5)

Assets held by an appointed person in accordance with a requirement of a type
referred to in paragraph (3) shall not be released or dealt with except in accordance
with directions given by the Court or in such circumstances as may be specified by
it.

to assets outside Jersey.

(7)

The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to any right of any
aggrieved person to bring proceedings directly in respect of any right such person
may otherwise have independently of the Commission.

in such form (if any) as the notice under this paragraph may specify.

(7)

If, under this Article, a person provides documents in the person’s possession but
claims a lien on the documents so provided, the provision of the documents shall

(8)

The power under this Article to require documents to be provided includes power –

(9)

(a)

if the documents are provided, to retain them, to take copies of them or to
take extracts from them, and to require the person providing the documents,
or any person who appears to possess information relating to the documents,
to provide an explanation of them; or

(b)

if the documents are not provided, to require the person to whom the
requirement was directed to state, to the best of the person’s knowledge and
belief, where they are.

If documents provided under this Article are retained under paragraph (8)(a) the
documents may be so retained –

powers under paragraph (4), the person shall be guilty of an offence and liable to
imprisonment for a term of 6 months and a fine.
(12) Nothing in this Article shall require the disclosure or provision by a person to the
Commission, an officer or an agent of information, or documents, that the person
would, in proceedings in the Court, be entitled to refuse to disclose or to provide on
the grounds of legal professional privilege, except, if the person is a lawyer, the
name and address of his or her client.
(13) A statement made by a person in compliance with a requirement imposed under
