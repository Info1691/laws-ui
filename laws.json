in breach of trust.
The reservation or grant by a settlor of a trust of –

any or all of the powers mentioned in paragraph (2),

Official Consolidated Version
14 February 2023 – Current
Page - 12Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 Article 12
(3) (ii) (iii) the trust is immoral or contrary to public policy, or
the terms of the trust are so uncertain that its performance is rendered
impossible.25
Where a trust is created for 2 or more purposes of which some are lawful and
others are unlawful –
(a) (b) if those purposes cannot be separated the trust shall be invalid;
where those purposes can be separated the court may declare that the trust is
valid as to the purposes which are lawful.
(4) Where a trust is partially invalid the court may declare what property is trust
property, and what property is not trust property.
(5) Where paragraph (2)(a)(iii) applies, any person in whom the title to such
immovable property is vested shall not be, and shall not be deemed to be, a trustee
of such immovable property.
(6) Property as to which a trust is wholly or partially invalid shall, subject to

the trust provide for the appointment of an enforcer in relation to its non-charitable
purposes, and for the appointment of a new enforcer at any time when there is none.
13 Enforcers27
(1) (2) (3) It shall be the duty of an enforcer to enforce the trust in relation to its non-
charitable purposes.
The appointment of a person as enforcer of a trust in relation to its non-charitable
purposes shall not have effect if the person is also a trustee of the trust.
Article 21(4) shall apply to an enforcer as if the reference in sub-paragraph (b) of
that paragraph to “a trustee” were a reference to “an enforcer” and the references in
that sub-paragraph to the “trustee’s trusteeship” and “such trusteeship” were both
references to the “enforcer’s appointment”.
14 Resignation or removal of enforcer28
(1) Subject to paragraph (3), an enforcer may resign his or her office by notice in
writing delivered to the trustee.
(2) A resignation takes effect on the delivery of notice in accordance with

(1) Unless its terms provide otherwise, a trust may continue in existence for an
unlimited period.
(2) No rule against perpetuities or excessive accumulations shall apply to a trust or to
any advancement, appointment, payment or application of assets from a trust.
(3) Except where the terms of a trust provide to the contrary, any advancement,
appointment, payment or application of assets from that trust to another trust shall
be valid even if that other trust may continue after the date by which the first trust
must terminate.
Appointment, retirement and discharge of trustees
16 Number of trustees30
(1) (2) Subject to the terms of the trust, a trust must have at least one trustee.
A trust shall not fail on grounds of having fewer trustees than required by this Law
or the terms of the trust.

paragraph (1) or, if greater, by the terms of the trust, the required number of new
trustees must be appointed as soon as practicable.
(4) While there are fewer trustees than are required by the terms of the trust, the
existing trustees may only act for the purpose of preserving the trust property.

trustee;

(b) the last remaining trustee; or
(c) the personal representative or liquidator of the last remaining trustee.32
Subject to the terms of the trust, a trustee appointed under this Article shall have
the same powers, discretions and duties and may act as if the trustee had been
originally appointed a trustee.
A trustee having power to appoint a new trustee who fails to exercise such power
may be removed from office by the court.
On the appointment of a new or additional trustee anything requisite for vesting the
trust property in the trustees for the time being of the trust shall be done.
18 Prohibition of renunciation after acceptance
(1) No person shall be obliged to accept appointment as a trustee, but a person who
knowingly does any act or thing in relation to the trust property consistent with the
status of a trustee of that property shall be deemed to have accepted appointment as
a trustee.
(2) (3) A person who has not accepted and is not deemed to have accepted appointment as

The court shall not approve an arrangement under paragraph (3) unless it is
satisfied that any person with a material interest in the trust has had an opportunity
to be heard.
